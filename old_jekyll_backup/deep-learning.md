Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. These deep neural networks can learn hierarchical representations of data, with each layer extracting increasingly abstract features.

## Key Architectures

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Primarily used for image processing and computer vision
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Designed for sequential data like text or time series
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A special RNN architecture that addresses the vanishing gradient problem
- Transformers: Attention-based models that have revolutionized natural language processing
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Used for generating new data instances
- Autoencoders: Used for unsupervised learning of efficient encodings

## Major Breakthroughs

- AlexNet (2012): Breakthrough in image classification
- Word2Vec (2013): Vector representations of words
- Transformer architecture (2017): Attention-based models
- BERT (2018): Bidirectional language understanding
- GPT series: Increasingly powerful generative language models

Deep learning has enabled significant advances in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other fields.
