# About Me

> *"The best way to understand something is to build it, break it, and then build it better."*

## Hey there, I'm Aayush!

Welcome to my digital space! I'm a **machine learning researcher** with a passion for teaching machines to understand and create audio. This is where I share my thoughts, experiments, discoveries, and everything that doesn't fit into a formal research paper.

Think of this as my **public notebook** - a mix of technical deep-dives, project walkthroughs, personal notes, and honest reflections on the world of ML.

## What I'm Up To Now

Currently working as an **ML Researcher at [Sarvam](https://www.sarvam.ai/)**, where I'm focused on:

- **Audio Foundation Models**: Building the next generation of voice-to-voice systems
- **Music Generation**: Developing AI systems that can compose and create music
- **Research**: Pushing the boundaries of what's possible in audio AI

*Previously, I was a Founding Data Scientist at [Nurix](https://www.nurix.ai/) where I built Dialogue Manager (Semantic-VAD) for Audio Bots.*

## My Journey Through ML

### **Professional Experience**

#### **[Sarvam](https://www.sarvam.ai/)** | *ML Researcher*
Currently building audio foundation models for voice-2-voice applications and developing music generation systems. My work focuses on pushing the boundaries of what's possible in audio AI architectures.

#### **[Nurix](https://www.nurix.ai/)** | *Founding Data Scientist*
Built a SOTA Dialogue Manager that detects turn-ends, pauses, and interruptions.

#### **[ConvoZen.AI](https://convozen.ai/)** | *Associate Data Scientist*
Developed AI-driven contact center intelligence solutions including an Indic ASR model with, co-developed the ConvoZen LLM from dataset creation to fine-tuning, and delivered an Indic NER model.

### **Research Internships**

#### **Elucidata** | *NLP Intern*
Built a Federated Weak Learning framework for unlabeled data with Multi-NER models achieving 88% accuracy. Delivered a Dockerized system demo that was accepted for AMIA '22 in Washington, DC.

#### **University of Utah** | *NLP Research Intern*
Built custom RoBERTa + BiLSTM models that tap external knowledge graphs (ConceptNet, WordNet). Improved Infotabs NLI benchmark by 7.5% and published the [Trans-KBLSTM paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.deelio-1.7/).

#### **Envestnet | Yodlee India** | Data Science Project Trainee
Instituted prior framework using BiLSTMs, Bayesian networks, ARIMA and statistical methods for wealth recommendations. Built end-to-end data agnostic system with self-evaluation criteria that enhanced problem-specific model choice, yielding 15% increase in recommendations consumed.

## Projects & Research

### **[Trans-KBLSTM](https://aclanthology.org/2022.deelio-1.7/)** | *2022*
External knowledge-enhanced transformer for tabular reasoning
- **Best Paper Award** at DeeLIO-ACL, Dublin
- Enhanced NLI performance using ConceptNet and WordNet

### **[Structural Transitions of Dehydrin Protein](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.biochem.5c00222)** | *2025*
Investigated structural changes in DHN1 (dehydrin) protein from *Zea mays* using spectroscopic techniques (CD, fluorescence, FRET). The study revealed disorder-to-order transitions in response to temperature and chemical stressors, providing insights into plant stress tolerance mechanisms. Published in *Biochemistry* with contributions to protein engineering and stress response analysis.

## Academic Background

**B.Tech in Biotechnology** | IIT Guwahati | *2019-2023*
- Convener, MLRW'22
- Member, IITG.ai & Consulting and Analytics Club

*Interesting journey: Started with biotechnology, ended up teaching machines to understand and generate audio.*
