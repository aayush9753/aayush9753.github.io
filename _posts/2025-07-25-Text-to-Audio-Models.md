## My Journey into Text to Audio Models

I am studying text to audio models with more focus towards Music Generation models.

# Text-To-Music Models

### 1. [Mustango: Toward Controllable Text-to-Music Generation](https://aayush9753.github.io/mustango-toward-controllable-text-to-music-generation.html)
Mustango is a diffusion-based text-to-music model that enables structured control over **chords, beats, tempo,** and **key** directly from natural-language prompts.
It covers:
- Fundamentals of Music
- MuNet: Music-Aware UNet Denoiser
- MusicBench: A Richly Augmented Dataset - built on top of MusicCaps. (Over 52000 samples)
