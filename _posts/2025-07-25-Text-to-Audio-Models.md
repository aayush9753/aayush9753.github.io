## My Journey into Text to Audio Models

I am studying text to audio models with more focus towards Music Generation models.

# Text-To-Music Models

### 1. [Step-by-Step Diffusion: An Elementary Tutorial](https://aayush9753.github.io/step-by-step-diffusion-an-elementary-tutorial.html)

This covers the fundamentals of diffusion models including:
- How diffusion models work by gradually adding and removing noise
- DDPM (stochastic sampling) and DDIM (deterministic sampling) algorithms
- Flow matching as a generalization beyond Gaussian noise
- Practical implementation details and best practices

### 2. [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://aayush9753.github.io/denoising-diffusion-probabilistic-models.html)

- Covers a Image generation model created using diffusion.
- Focuses on Loss for the training and mathemetical derivations.
