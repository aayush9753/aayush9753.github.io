# Markdown

Following this Blog: [Markdown Crash Course](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2023-06/markdown-crash-course/)

## Markdown Basics

### Headings

Just like HTML, Markdown has six levels of headings. Each `#` represents a heading level with `#` being the largest heading and `######` being the smallest heading.

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6
```

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs in Markdown are the default text layout. 
- If you just type text it will automatically be converted to a paragraph. 
- If you want to seperate text into two seperate paragraphs you need to add a blank line between each set of text. 
- If you instead just want to have a new line within your paragraph you can add two spaces at the end of the line and it will be converted to a new line.

```markdown
This is a paragraph.
  
Since there is a new line between these two sentences they will be converted to two separate paragraphs.

This paragraph
has new lines in it
but
it will not show up as a new line in the output.

This paragraph
has two spaces HERE  
so it will push this onto a new line within the same paragraph.
```

## Extended Markdown

One important thing to note about Markdown is that there are a lot of different variations, typically referred to as flavors. 

- The base version of Markdown is quite a bit more limited in the formatting/styling you can do with it, but most websites that use Markdown will use some flavor which extends on Markdown. 
- For example, GitHub uses a flavor of Markdown called [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) which adds a lot of extra features to Markdown.
- We will explore Github Flavored Markdown more.

## Text Styling

Besides just determing what element your text should render as, you can also determine how your text should be styled.

### Bold/Italics

The two most common types of text are bold and italics. These can be generated by using one `*` or `_` wrapping your text for italics or two `*` or `_` for bold.

```markdown
*This is italicized text*

_This is also italicized text_

**This is bold text**

__This is also bold text__

***This is both***

___This is also both___
```

*This is italicized text*

_This is also italicized text_

**This is bold text**

__This is also bold text__

In order to combine bold and italics you can just wrap your text in three `*` or `_` and it will be both bold and italicized.

***This is both***

___This is also both___

Generally, it is recommended to use `*` instead of `_` since somtimes Markdown does not work well if you have `_` in the middle of a word.

### Strikethrough

```markdown
~~Crossed off~~
```

~~Crossed off~~

### Highlight 

```markdown
<mark>Highlighted</mark>
```
<mark>Highlighted</mark>

### Superscript/Subscript

```markdown
This is a <sup>superscript</sup>

This is a <sub>subscript</sub>
```
This is a <sup>superscript</sup>

This is a <sub>subscript</sub>

### Emoji

- Just copy the emoji into your Markdown and it will work. ðŸ˜Š

## Handling Code

One of the most common uses of Markdown is to display code. 
- By default you can display code inline or in a code block.

### Inline Code

To display code inline you can wrap your code in a single `` ` `` character. This is useful for displaying small snippets of code within a paragraph.

```markdown
This is `inline code` within a paragraph.
```

This is `inline code` within a paragraph.

### Code Blocks

To display a larger block of code you can wrap your code in three `` ` `` characters. 
- You can also specify the language of your code block by adding the language name after the three `` ` `` characters. 

```js
// This is a code block
const a = 1;

// This is a code block
const b = 2;

// This is a code block
const c = 3;
```

### Lists

There are two types of lists in Markdown, ordered and unordered. 
- To create an unordered list you can add a `-`, `*`, or `+` character before each item in your list. 
- To create an ordered list you can add a number followed by a `.` character before each item in your list. The actual order of the numbers you use does not matter. 
- You can also nest lists by indenting them with four spaces and/or a tab.

```markdown
- This is an unordered list
- Of items

1. This is an ordered list
2. The numbers do not matter
1. This says 3
    * This is a nested list
    * Of items
        1. This is a nested
        2. List of items
```


- This is an unordered list
- Of items

1. This is an ordered list
2. The numbers do not matter
1. This says 3
    * This is a nested list
    * Of items
        1. This is a nested
        2. List of items`

### Tables

- To create a table you need to create a list of rows where each column is separated by a `|` and each row starts and ends with a `|` as well. 
- Below the first row you need to add a row where each column consists of at least three `-`s and optionally a `:` character on either side of the `-`s. 
   - The `:` character is used to align the text in the column. 
   - If you add a `:` character on the left side of the `-`s then the text will be left aligned. 
   - If you add a `:` character on the right side of the `-`s then the text will be right aligned. 
   - If you add a `:` character on both sides of the `-`s then the text will be center aligned
- Finally, you can continue to add rows to your table with the same format as your first row.

```markdown
| Col 1 | Col 2   |
| ----- | ------- |
| This  | is      |
| an    | example |
| table | with    |
| two   | columns |

| Right  | Center | Left |
| -----: | :----: | :--- |
| R      | C      | L    |

| Head One | Head Two |
| --- | --- |
| Does Not Need | To Be |
| Aligned | Properly |
```

### Checklist
Add a `- [ ]` or `- [x]` before each item in your list. 
- The `- [ ]` will create an unchecked checkbox
- The `- [x]` will create a checked checkbox.

```markdown
- [ ] Unchecked
- [x] Checked
```
