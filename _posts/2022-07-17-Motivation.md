# Why This Website Exists

> *"I write to learn, not to teach. If others learn from my notes, that's a happy accident."*

## The Problem with Forgetting

Let me be honest - I have a terrible memory. I can spend hours reading a fascinating paper, implementing a complex algorithm, or debugging a tricky issue, only to find myself struggling to recall the details a few weeks later. The brilliant insights I had while reading that transformer paper? Gone. The clever trick I used to optimize my audio model? Somewhere in the void of my brain.

This website is my solution to that problem.

## My Digital Memory Bank

### **For My Future Self**

This space is primarily designed for one person: **me, six months from now**. When I'm stuck on a problem and I have that nagging feeling that I've solved something similar before, I can come here and find my past thoughts, experiments, and solutions laid out clearly.

### **Reading Notes & Research**

I read a lot - papers, blog posts, documentation, books. But reading without writing is like thinking without a trace. This website serves as my:

- **Paper summaries** with key insights and personal thoughts
- **Research notes** documenting my understanding and interpretations
- **Implementation details** of algorithms and techniques I've tried
- **Debugging chronicles** of problems I've encountered and solved

### **Learning Through Writing**

Writing forces clarity. When I try to explain a concept or document an experiment, I often discover gaps in my understanding. The act of writing becomes a learning tool itself - it reveals what I truly understand versus what I just think I understand.

## The Structure of My Thoughts

### **Blogs: Polished Reflections**

The blog section contains more polished thoughts - complete ideas, project walkthroughs, and insights that might be useful to others. These are the pieces where I've taken time to structure my thoughts and present them coherently.

### **Notes: Raw and Unfiltered**

The notes section is more personal and immediate. It's where I dump:

- **Quick insights** from papers I'm reading
- **Experimental results** and their interpretations
- **Code snippets** that I want to remember
- **Random thoughts** that might connect to something later
- **Questions** that I want to explore further

## Why Public?

You might wonder why I'm sharing my personal notes publicly. Here's why:

### **Accountability**

Knowing that others might read my notes encourages me to be more thoughtful and accurate. It's a form of quality control.

### **Serendipitous Connections**

Sometimes the most valuable insights come from unexpected connections. By sharing my notes, I increase the chances of someone pointing out a connection I missed or offering a different perspective.

### **Contributing to the Community**

The ML and audio research communities have given me so much through open papers, code, and discussions. If my notes help even one person understand a concept better or avoid a mistake I made, then sharing them is worthwhile.

### **Future Collaborations**

These notes serve as a window into my thinking process. Potential collaborators can see what I'm working on, what I'm struggling with, and where our interests might align.

## What You'll Find Here

### **Technical Deep-Dives**

Detailed explorations of algorithms, architectures, and techniques. These are the posts where I really dig into the math and implementation details.

### **Paper Summaries**

My understanding of important papers, with focus on the insights that matter for my work. I try to extract the key ideas and place them in context.

### **Project Journals**

Documentation of ongoing projects, including failed experiments and dead ends. These are often the most valuable notes for my future self.

### **Random Musings**

Thoughts about the field, predictions about future directions, and connections between seemingly unrelated concepts.

### **Tools and Tricks**

Useful code snippets, debugging techniques, and workflow optimizations that I want to remember.

## The Evolution of Understanding

One thing I've learned is that understanding is not binary - it's a spectrum. My notes capture that evolution:

- **Initial confusion** when encountering new concepts
- **Gradual clarity** as I work through examples
- **Deeper insights** that come from implementation
- **Connections** to other work that emerge over time

By documenting this journey, I create a more complete picture of how I learn and think.

## A Living Document

This website is constantly evolving. Notes get updated as my understanding deepens. Blog posts get refined as I learn more. The archive becomes a record of my intellectual journey through the fascinating world of machine learning and audio AI.

## For You, the Reader

If you've made it this far, you're probably someone who values learning and documentation. While this website is primarily for me, I hope you find something useful here:

- **Learn from my mistakes** so you don't have to make them
- **Get inspired** by the problems I'm working on
- **Reach out** if you want to discuss any of the topics I cover
- **Share your own insights** if you have a different perspective

Remember, these are my personal notes and reflections. They're not authoritative sources - they're one person's attempt to make sense of complex topics. Take what's useful, question what seems wrong, and add your own thoughts to the conversation.
