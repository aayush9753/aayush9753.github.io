## My Journey into Diffusion Models

I am studying diffusion models from scratch, diving deep into the mathematical foundations and practical implementations. This blog serves as a central hub that summarizes all my readings, notes, and reference blogs that I'm writing on diffusion models. As I explore this fascinating field, I'll be documenting my learnings through detailed posts that break down complex concepts into digestible explanations.

## Blog Posts on Diffusion Models

### 1. [Step-by-Step Diffusion: An Elementary Tutorial](https://aayush9753.github.io/step-by-step-diffusion-an-elementary-tutorial.html)

This tutorial covers the fundamentals of diffusion models including:
- How diffusion models work by gradually adding and removing noise
- DDPM (stochastic sampling) and DDIM (deterministic sampling) algorithms
- Flow matching as a generalization beyond Gaussian noise
- Practical implementation details and best practices
