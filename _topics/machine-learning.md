Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. It encompasses a wide range of algorithms and techniques for pattern recognition, prediction, and data analysis.

## Key Areas

- Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled training data
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment
- Deep Learning: Using neural networks with multiple layers

## Prominent Algorithms

- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- K-means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis

Machine learning has applications across numerous domains including computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.
